This is a draft from long ago. I shared it at that time and, if it's the version I'm thinking of, it was redirected to Policy Analysis. I simultaneously took a job that prevented me from pursuing its publication further.

Working Title: "Propensity Scores Should Be Used for Matching to Avoid the Paradox of Simple Distance Methods"

The use of Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was re-examined in light of 
the "Propensity Score Paradox" described by King and Nielsen (2018). 
Data from King's simulations were found to contain unreported 
statistical properties which mitigate the performance degradation of PSM 
in even the most highly artificial of conditions. Additionally, PSM was 
found to outperform Mahalanobis Distance Matching (MDM) when assumptions 
underlying the simulations' data generating process were altered to make 
them more reflective of real-world conditions in observational research.
